Face recognition using Computer Vision was first attemped, then I tried with Deep Learning. 

## Computer Vision

Face classifier was trained using either Haar Cascade or Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features.

It is then deployed by using OpenCV

## Deep Learning

I downloaded [face_recognition](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition) which used
dlib's state-of-the-art face recognition built with deep learning.
